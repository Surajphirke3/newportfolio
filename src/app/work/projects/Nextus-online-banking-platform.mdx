## Overview

**Nextus** is a modern financial SaaS platform that centralizes personal banking needs into one powerful dashboard. The aim was to simplify how users interact with their finances by enabling seamless multi-bank account integration, secure fund transfers, real-time transaction tracking, and insightful data visualization. Designed for scalability and user trust, Nextus empowers users with full control and clarity over their financial life.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Bank Aggregation**: Integrated secure APIs like **Plaid** to allow users to connect and sync data from multiple bank accounts into a unified dashboard.
- **Real-Time Transaction Monitoring**: Users can view live transactions, categorized automatically with smart tags and dynamic filtering.
- **Fund Transfer System**: Enabled instant and scheduled peer-to-peer money transfers using **Dwolla**, with user authentication and email verification.
- **Interactive Financial Dashboard**: Visualizations built with charting libraries to help users track spending, income trends, and account balances.
- **User Auth & Security**: Implemented role-based authentication using **Appwrite**, supporting secure signup/login, sessions, and token handling.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js + TypeScript**: For building a performant, scalable front-end with strong typing and modern SSR/SSG capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast, utility-first responsive UI styling.
- **Appwrite**: For authentication, database, and backend APIs.
- **Plaid & Dwolla APIs**: For banking integration and payment functionalities.
- **Chart.js / Recharts**: To visualize financial data with clarity.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD deployment pipeline and automatic code formatting with linting tools.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was handling sensitive financial data securely while maintaining seamless user experience. Integrating third-party financial APIs like Plaid required careful authentication flows, error handling, and sandbox testing. Managing real-time data updates across different accounts and syncing them into a coherent dashboard required building a robust state management and syncing strategy.

Building a secure and intuitive fund transfer system was also complex, especially considering compliance, validation, and user feedback during transfers. Designing a consistent and professional UI/UX across all screens was essential to building user trust.

## Outcome

Nextus successfully streamlined the way users manage their financial lives. With real-time visibility, smart analytics, and seamless banking actions, users experience complete control over their money—without switching between apps. The platform is fully responsive, highly performant, and designed to scale with future features like budgeting tools, savings goals, and business integrations.

This project demonstrates my ability to architect and build full-stack systems that are secure, scalable, and user-centric, while maintaining clean UI and professional design standards.
