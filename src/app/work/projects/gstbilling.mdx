## Overview

The **GST Billing App** is a native Android application built to simplify the billing and taxation process for small and medium-scale businesses in India. It allows users to generate GST-compliant invoices, manage products and customers, and track financial records seamlessly on their Android devices.

## Key Features

- ðŸ§¾ **Bill Creation**: Generate itemized invoices with automatic GST (CGST & SGST) calculation.
- ðŸ“¦ **Product Management**: Add, edit, and organize product details with pricing and tax rates.
- ðŸ‘¥ **Customer Handling**: Store and manage customer information for recurring billing.
- ðŸ“Š **Reports & Insights**: Generate sales reports and billing summaries for accounting.
- ðŸ“„ **PDF Invoice Generation**: Export bills as downloadable and shareable PDFs.
- ðŸ”’ **Offline Data Storage**: Secure, lightweight storage using SQLite with no need for internet.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** â€“ Core language for backend logic and Android development.
- **Android Studio** â€“ IDE for development and testing.
- **XML** â€“ For UI layout design.
- **SQLite** â€“ Local database for storing user, product, and invoice data.
- **iText (or equivalent)** â€“ For generating PDF invoices programmatically.

## Challenges and Learnings

Working with tax logic (like applying both CGST and SGST) required precision and testing to avoid rounding errors. Ensuring a seamless UX across devices also taught me the importance of responsive design and state management. Implementing offline support with SQLite gave me deeper insight into local persistence strategies.

## Outcome

This project empowered me with real-world app development experience tailored to Indian financial compliance. The app is ideal for shopkeepers, freelancers, and small businesses that need a dependable and portable billing solution.
