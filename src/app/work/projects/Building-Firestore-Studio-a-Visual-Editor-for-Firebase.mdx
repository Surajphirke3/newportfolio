## Overview

Firestore Studio is a visual dashboard and database editor built to simplify the development process with Firebase Firestore. Designed with developers in mind, it provides a clean, intuitive interface to view, edit, and manage collections and documents without writing Firestore queries manually.

## Key Features

- **Visual Collection Manager**: Navigate and edit Firestore documents and collections with a real-time tree-view structure. Add, update, or delete data using point-and-click UI.
- **Query Builder**: Build advanced Firestore queries visually, including filters, sorting, and pagination, without touching code.
- **Authentication Layer**: Integrated Firebase Auth to secure access. Admins can control permissions and roles for collaborators.
- **Theme Support**: Built-in light/dark theme toggle and accent customization to match your branding preferences.
- **Live Sync & Auto Refresh**: Real-time syncing using Firestore listeners to reflect database changes instantly across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building the UI and server-side logic with API routes.
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: For secure backend access to Firestore via service account.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: For building a fast, responsive, and accessible interface.
- **Firebase Auth**: For secure login and role-based access control.
- **Zustand + SWR**: For state management and fast data fetching.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was maintaining security while providing full database control through the UI. We implemented strict Firestore rules and admin-side checks via Firebase Admin SDK. Syncing real-time updates across nested collections without overwhelming the frontend also required careful optimization.

We also learned how important intuitive design is — especially when building tools for developers. Our design process involved quick feedback loops using Figma and user testing with real Firebase users.

## Outcome

Firestore Studio is now actively used internally and by a small group of testers. It has cut Firestore debugging and admin work by over 60%, made onboarding easier for non-technical collaborators, and opened doors for future features like export/import, batch operations, and analytics views.

We’re currently planning to open source Firestore Studio to help more teams streamline their Firebase workflows.
