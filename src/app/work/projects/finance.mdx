## Overview

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based financial chatbot** developed in Python. It allows users to ask finance-related questions (like taxes, savings, budgeting, investing), and responds with accurate, context-aware answers by combining local document retrieval and large language models (LLMs).

It was designed to assist users who are not financially literate and want clear, trustworthy, and personalized financial advice without sifting through complex web resources.

## Key Features

- ðŸ’¬ **Natural Language Q&A**: Users can ask questions in everyday language.
- ðŸ“š **Contextual Retrieval**: Uses vector databases and embeddings to fetch relevant documents.
- ðŸ§  **RAG Architecture**: Combines document context with generative LLM response.
- ðŸ”’ **Secure & Local**: Can work offline with custom-trained datasets for privacy.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Financial Knowledge Base**: Includes curated finance-related PDFs, CSVs, and scraped web data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Core programming language.
- **LangChain** â€“ Framework to build RAG pipelines.
- **ChromaDB** â€“ Vector database for embedding and retrieval.
- **Mistral** â€“ Large language model for advanced text generation.
- **PyPDF** â€“ For processing PDF documents and extracting relevant data.
- **Pandas / Requests** â€“ For preprocessing documents and datasets.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a hybrid RAG system required fine-tuning the embedding quality and retrieval filters to ensure the chatbot fetched relevant financial context. I learned how to optimize prompts, manage token limits, and improve accuracy using document chunking and metadata filtering.

Additionally, latency handling and maintaining a lightweight system for quick local responses taught me efficient system design.

## Outcome

The chatbot offers a solid base for intelligent personal finance assistance tools. It can be extended into a full-scale assistant for banks, fintech platforms, or educational tools. This project sharpened my skills in NLP, prompt engineering, and AI system integration using Python.
