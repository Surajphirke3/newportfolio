## Overview

The **Financial Literacy Project** was developed during a Google Hackathon to address a widespread issue—lack of basic financial education among youth and students. This responsive web app was built to teach users concepts like budgeting, saving, investing, loans, and taxes through interactive modules, quizzes, and visual guides. It empowers users with the tools they need to make smart financial decisions from an early age.

## Key Features

- **Modular Learning System**: Users can explore core topics like budgeting, compound interest, credit scores, and tax planning, all in bite-sized modules.
- **Gamified Quizzes**: Built-in interactive quizzes reinforce learning and reward users with progress badges.
- **Financial Tools**: Included utilities like a budget calculator, EMI calculator, and savings goal tracker to apply learned concepts.
- **Progress Tracking**: User dashboard tracks progress through different modules and quizzes.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly and accessible across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js + TypeScript**: For fast, server-rendered educational pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For clean, responsive UI components and styling.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user progress, quiz data, and content modules.
- **Appwrite**: For user authentication and backend logic.
- **Chart.js**: To visualize budget, savings, and financial growth metrics.
- **Framer Motion**: For subtle animations and better engagement.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was simplifying complex financial topics without losing accuracy or depth. The team focused on creating a user flow that felt intuitive and engaging, especially for users without prior knowledge. Integrating multiple tools like calculators and graphs while keeping the UI clean also pushed our front-end design thinking.

Working within the time constraints of a hackathon taught the team rapid prototyping, MVP mindset, and collaborative debugging across backend and frontend logic.

## Outcome

The platform was well-received by hackathon judges and peers, especially for its user-first design and social impact. It’s now being expanded into a full product that schools and colleges can deploy. The project highlights my capability to build socially responsible full-stack apps, blending education with technology to solve real-world problems.
