## Overview

**Firestore Studio** is a modular visual editor built on **MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) server principles**. Designed to streamline the Firebase Firestore experience, it allows developers to explore and manipulate Firestore databases visually. By leveraging MCP architecture, Firestore Studio separates models (documents/collections), context (auth, roles, theme), and protocol (API/websocket sync), enabling better scalability, real-time collaboration, and modular logic.

---

## Key Features

- **Model-Based Firestore Editor**: Each Firestore document and collection is modeled as a separate MCP unit. This allows independent querying, mutation, and caching of models.
  
- **Context-Aware UI**: Access to Firestore data is dynamically adjusted based on the user’s role, project, or theme settings — all injected via the `context` layer of the MCP server.

- **Protocol Flexibility**: Real-time updates are streamed via WebSockets, while admin mutations go through secure HTTP routes powered by the Firebase Admin SDK.

- **Visual Query Builder**: Users can create complex Firestore queries visually, which are then translated into MCP-compliant calls for filtering, sorting, and pagination.

- **Auth + Permission Management**: Firebase Auth integrates with MCP’s context resolver to ensure access control is enforced before data/model access occurs.

- **Theming via Context Tokens**: UI themes, accent colors, and layout preferences are context-driven and customizable per user or workspace.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For UI rendering and API routes with ISR.
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: To securely interact with Firestore using service account access.
- **Zustand + SWR**: For reactive state management and model-level caching.
- **React + Tailwind CSS**: For dynamic, responsive UI.
- **Firebase Auth**: Integrated into the MCP context to resolve access rights.
- **MCP Server Pattern**: Used to structure backend services around Models, Contexts, and Protocol interfaces.
