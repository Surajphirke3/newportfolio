## Overview

**CropChain**, also known as the AgriVision project, addresses key inefficiencies in the agricultural ecosystem — from unpredictable crop yields to improper distribution and waste management. The platform provides a smart solution that visualizes production data, predicts demand, and suggests optimal routes and methods for distribution, reducing waste and maximizing profit for farmers and suppliers.

## Key Features

- **Crop Production System**: Tracks crop yield based on real-time data such as demand, pricing trends, and supply forecasts.
- **Distribution Intelligence**: Suggests efficient distribution paths and highlights surplus or shortage zones to balance supply and demand.
- **Waste Reduction Analysis**: Identifies areas of overproduction and spoilage, offering data-backed recommendations to minimize waste.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrates dynamic charts and graphs for intuitive analysis of agricultural trends and decision-making support.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Personalized interfaces for farmers, vendors, and administrators with tailored controls and data access.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**: For building a responsive and visually rich frontend with optimal performance.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing crop data, user profiles, production logs, and waste analysis reports.
- **Express.js & Node.js**: Power the backend APIs and manage authentication, analytics, and dashboard logic.
- **Chart.js / Recharts**: Implements real-time and historical data visualizations for analytics-driven insights.
- **Figma**: For designing wireframes and UI prototypes, ensuring smooth user experience across devices.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing a meaningful and scalable solution for the agricultural domain required careful planning of the data model and user interface. The biggest challenge was building dynamic visualizations that were both informative and easy to interpret for non-technical users. This experience deepened my understanding of design thinking, API architecture, and agricultural domain modeling.

## Outcome

CropChain has been recognized for its impactful use of technology in agriculture. It empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, supports food security through waste reduction, and builds bridges between production and distribution using data as the foundation. The project continues to grow with future plans to integrate machine learning for yield prediction and blockchain for supply transparency.
